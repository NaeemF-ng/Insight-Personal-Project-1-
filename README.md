# Insight-Personal-Project-1-

This is my first personal project where i'll be doing some basic port scanning with the tool nmap. I use the following commands -sV (to list the names of the services ruuning on the target), -O (to list the operating system of the target), -sC (to run default scripts), -vv (for verbose output providing more details from the scan), -p- (to scan all ports on the target), subnet scanning, -sS (stealth scanning), http-enumeration script (manually), ftp anonymous script (for attempting to login anonymously), and the ssh brute script (to attempt to brute force ssh credentials). These are all of the commands and scripts that i've used so far and that I use regularly, some of them provide valuable information that can be used to gain access to the target, I have the intention of adding pictures so you can see my scan results. However, i'm new to github so im not sure if i'll be doing it correctly, I will be adding on to this because as I gain more knowledge regarding my pentesting journey and in general i'll be practing more in my homelab so stay tuned for a "Insight Personal Project" part 2, 3, 4, etc.
